<p>This is more difficult than I thought, building a website from scratch, but I suppose that's how I wanted to feel. This is my first "official" college course in about 7 years, so it's definitely taken me longer to get back into the groove, but now that I'm getting through the basic task of wrapping my head around all of these applications, commands, tags, etc., I <strong><i>think</i></strong> I'm getting the hang of it. Who would have thought the hardest part is memorizing how and where to save the files?!</p>
<p> Anyway, on to the synposis you came here to read: my name is Margo, I'm turning 30 at the end of July, and in my 29th year I'm cautiously optimistic yet proud to say that I've finally found my ideal career path in higher education. In January I joined George Mason's Office of Advancement & Alumni Relations as the Operations Coordinator, and I love what I do. I've been interested in learning more about web design for years, but it's been hard to make myself watch endless Lynda videos without a real life project at hand. Now, I help maintain our department's internal directory hosted on Dreamweaver, and that has given me enough practice to get even more interested in coding languages and their presence in essentially every aspect of our modern lives.</p>
<p> I joined this class to start learning the real foundations of HTML and Web Design, beyond simply editing a webpage someone else created. I'm overwhelmed and confused by a lot of what I've read through so far, but in time I know I'll find my confidence in web editing just like I did with video editing, copy editing, and all of the other modes of communication I've studied during my lifelong pursuit of a well-rounded liberal arts education.</p>
